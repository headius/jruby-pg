= pg

This is a JRuby gem replacement for ruby-pg. The gem should be a
drop-in replacement for ruby-pg version 0.17.1. If you see any
inconsistency please open an issue
{here}[https://github.com/headius/jruby-pg/issues].

Another JRuby Postgres adapter is {jdbc-postgres}[https://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter/tree/master/jdbc-postgres/]. jruby-pg provides a few interfaces that jdbc-postgres doesn't have. Most use cases don't require those interfaces, specially if you are using ActiveRecord. Extra APIs in the pg & jruby-pg gem include:

* Async API for querying
* Large objects API
* Bulk Copy API
* Notification API

= Documentation

For documentation please refair to the MRI pg gem docs which you can
find {here}[http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/pg/0.17.1/PG]. The original
ruby-pg project can be found {here on github}[https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg].

* JRuby 1.7.1 or later (due to https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/411)
* JRuby in 1.9 or 2.0 mode
* json gem 1.7.7 or later (see https://github.com/flori/json/pull/152 and

== How To Install

*NOTE*: if you are installing jruby-pg to use it with rails you'll
have to install it using bundler.

Install via RubyGems:

    gem install pg_jruby

Install via Bundler, in your gemfile add the following:

    # Please note that Bundler version 1.0 is necessary to let bundler do its dependency management,
    # as there is no .gemspec in the source.
    gem 'pg', '0.17.1', :platform => :jruby, :git => 'git://github.com/headius/jruby-pg.git', :branch => :master

    # comment the activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter line
    # gem 'activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter'

== Sample app

See {this app}[https://github.com/jvshahid/sample-jruby-pg] for a demonstration
of using jruby-pg with rails

Install via Bundler, in your gemfile add the following:

    # Please note that the 1.0 is necessary to let bundler do its dependency management, as there is no .gemspec in the source.
    gem 'jruby-pg', '1.0', :platform => :jruby, :git => 'git://github.com/headius/jruby-pg.git', :branch => :master
