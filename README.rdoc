= pg

* https://github.com/headius/jruby-pg

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a native implementation of the Postsgres protocol written
entirely in Java. The project was started by @headius as a ruby-pg
replacement for JRuby that uses the JDBC driver and private API of
Postgres. Unfortunately ruby-pg (which uses libpq under the hood)
exposed a lot of features of Postgres that were impossible to
implement or were complicated given the nature of the JDBC and the
encapsulation of many features that are exposed in ruby-pg.

== FEATURES:

* A ruby-pg drop in replacement for JRuby
* Async operations are supported
* Large Object API
* SSL connections
* Copy operations
* Zero dependencies on other jars and gems

== PROBLEMS:

* The current implementation targets postgres protocol V3 (introduced in v 7.4)
  only. I'll wait until someone ask for support of earlier versions.
* We need better test coverage since we're doing more than ruby-pg
* Run ActiveRecord and pg_search test suites on this implementation
* lo_import and lo_export are not implemented yet
* More Documentation especially in the parts that deal with the protocol.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Just a Postgres server and the gem.

== INSTALL:

* Currently we don't have the gem on rubygems, but I'll work on that if we can
  get a stable version out.

== DEVELOPERS:

After checking out the source, run:

  $ rake

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs.

There are currently two test suites that run, the ruby-pg specs and
more specs targetted towards the JRuby implementation details in
jruby-spec. When you run `rake` both test suites are merged under
the 'spec' directory.

You can set +PG_TEST_SLL+ to 1, e.g.

  $ PG_TEST_SLL=1 rake

to run the entire test suite using SSL sockets instead of plain sockets. Also

  $ test_all.sh

runs the test suite with and without SSL.
